# Monad for users

Monad is a high-performance Ethereum-compatible L1, offering users the best of both worlds: portability and performance.

From a portability perspective, Monad offers full bytecode compatibility for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), so that applications built for Ethereum can be ported to Monad without code changes, and full Ethereum RPC compatibility, so that infrastructure like MetaMask or Etherscan  can be used seamlessly.

From a performance perspective, Monad offers 10,000 tps of throughput, i.e. 1 billion transactions per day, while offering 1 second block times and 1 second finality.  This allows Monad to support many more users and far more interactive experiences than existing blockchains, while offering far cheaper per-transaction costs.

# What's familiar about Monad?

From a user perspective, Monad behaves very similarly to Ethereum. You can use the same wallets (e.g. MetaMask) or block explorers (e.g. Etherscan) to sign or view transactions. The same apps built for Ethereum can be ported to Monad without code changes, so it is expected that you'll be able to use many of your favorite apps from Ethereum on Monad. The address space in Monad is the same as in Ethereum, so you can reuse your existing keys.

Like Ethereum, Monad features linear blocks, and linear ordering of transactions within a block. 

Like Ethereum, Monad is a proof-of-stake network maintained by a decentralized set of validators. Anyone can run a node to independently verify transaction execution, and significant care has been taken to keep hardware requirements minimal.
